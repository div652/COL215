The programming for the source files has been done on VHDL

Simulation , synthesis , implementation , Bit Stream generation has been done using Xilinx's Vivado 2019.1



The repository contains various projects named as the assignment number. The project creates an additional file named report which is a description of the strategies used to do the assignment and accomplish the required task. 

The constraint file has been written for the Digilent's Basys 3 board. It utilises an Artix-7 35T FPGA.  This board is a complete, ready-to-use digital circuit development platform based on the latest Artix®-7 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) from Xilinx®. With its high-capacity FPGA (Xilinx part number **XC7A35T1CPG236C**). Documentation for the board can be found [here](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/basys-3/reference-manual  ). 

To run the projects on Vivado, open the .xpr file of the project in Vivado, this will automatically open and load the project in vivado . 

Alternatively if you want to access the separte files then they can be found in the corresponding Assignment folder at the following relative paths : 

**VHDL Source File(s)**  **:** ``` <Assignment-name>.srcs/sources_1/new/```

**Constraint File  :**    	 ```<Assignment-name>.srcs/constrs_1/new/```

**TestBench  :** 

**Bitstream (.bit) :** 	    ```<Assignment-name>.runs/impl_1/```
